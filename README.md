# fl-studio-alesis-vixx

A MIDI-script for use with the Alesis VI series MIDI controllers in conjunction with FL Studio

This most recent update is significant, with a lot of code changes, additional functionality, and customization options. I did my best to check for errors but, given the amount of changes, it is possible that something was missed. Please let me know any issues are encountered, otherwise I may never know. See the manual for info on how to report issues. Thanks.
