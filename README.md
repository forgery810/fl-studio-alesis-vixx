**** 2.03 Update ***

Fixed bug that prevented some of the buttons from functioning

	*********

**** 2.02 Update ****

New Layout for Sustain Pedal

Script Version 2.00 had a conflict between the Sustain Pedal and one of the knobs. To address this, in 2.02 the Sustain Pedal must be changed to Channel 2 in the Alesis Layout. New layouts have been added. Another small bug has been fixed and a couple of new functions added. If you don't use Sustain then this update may not be necessary. 

	*********

A MIDI-script for use with the Alesis VI series MIDI controllers in conjunction with FL Studio

This most recent update is significant, with a lot of code changes, additional functionality, and customization options. I did my best to check for errors but, given the amount of changes, it is possible that something was missed. Please let me know any issues are encountered, otherwise I may never know. See the manual for info on how to report issues. Thanks. 

**** New Layouts Must Be Uploaded to Controller ****
